ðŸ”„ CONTEXT RESTORED - VIROFORGE SESSION CONTINUES

ðŸ“‹ PROJECT STATUS:
   â€¢ Phase 1: ~80% complete (FASTQ generation production-ready)
   â€¢ Phase 2: In progress (12-week timeline - see docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
   â€¢ Current focus: Check lab-notebook/INDEX.md for active work

ðŸŽ¯ MISSION:
   â€¢ Generate realistic synthetic virome data with complete ground truth
   â€¢ Lab-agnostic, community-focused design
   â€¢ Publication-quality implementation and documentation
   â€¢ Literature-validated biological accuracy

ðŸ“š KEY DOCUMENTS:
   â€¢ .claude.md - Concise session context
   â€¢ lab-notebook/INDEX.md - Current status and recent work
   â€¢ docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Phase 2 detailed plan (12 weeks)
   â€¢ lab-notebook/sessions/YYYY-MM/ - Recent session notes
   â€¢ lab-notebook/topics/ - Topic evolution and design decisions

ðŸ”¬ CONTEXT RECOVERY:
   1. Read lab-notebook/INDEX.md "Active Status" section
   2. Check "In-Progress" sessions
   3. Review relevant topic docs in lab-notebook/topics/
   4. Continue from where we left off

CORE PRINCIPLES (DO NOT LOSE):
â€¢ Every feature must be lab-agnostic (flexible frameworks, not hard-coded protocols)
â€¢ Every parameter must have literature support
â€¢ Complete ground truth metadata is non-negotiable
â€¢ Documentation is for publication preparation (Nature Biotechnology level)
