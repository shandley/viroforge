# ViroForge - Development Context

**Last Updated**: 2026-07-30
**Current Version**: v0.20.0
**Status**: Issue #37 closed; microbial background complete; 480 tests green

---

## Session Handoff (2026-07-30)

origin/main at `0a936e0`, **v0.20.0**, clean, CI green. Full suite **480 passed,
11 skipped** (~8 min; background it, it exceeds a 300s foreground timeout).
Earlier handoffs are in git history and the memory files.

### Issue #37 closed: microbial background

Bacterial, fungal and archaeal background landed across 0.17.0-0.20.0, with
per-collection baselines, bundled RefSeq reference sets, and the
gut-bulk / gut-vlp / stool-clinical presets. A `--no-vlp` gut run now measures
71.8% bacterial / 4.1% viral / 2.5% fungal+archaeal against a real-bulk-stool
60-80 / 1-5 / 1-5. It was 81.6% viral in 0.16.0. VLP removes ~98% of the
background, so enrichment finally models what VLP prep is for.

Reference sets are built by `scripts/curate_bacterial_background.py --domain
{bacterial,fungal,archaeal}`, which resolves RefSeq by taxon NAME at build time
and fetches only 10 kb slices. No accessions are stored in the repository.

### Two changes invalidate datasets generated before 0.20.0

1. **Amplification was compounding GC bias over cycles.** `_apply_linker_bias`
   and `_apply_rdab_bias` raised `calculate_gc_efficiency()` to the power of the
   cycle count, but it returns a TOTAL relative efficiency. A 36% GC genome was
   suppressed 134x against a 50% GC one, a 29% GC one by 61,000x. 36% is the gut
   collection's median GC and `linker` is the default, so this distorted nearly
   every dataset. MDA was already correct.
2. **Every preset pointed at the wrong collection** since the 9-28 to 1-20
   renumbering. `--preset gut-standard` was generating wastewater.

Anything benchmarked before 0.20.0 needs regenerating.

### Backlog

**PR #51** (host_associations, deferred pending a real `body_site` column) and
**issue #30** (web visual form builder, not started). Nothing else open.

### Open questions, recorded not resolved

- The pore-less and column branches of `apply_enrichment` favour LARGE particles,
  opposite to the filtration curves. May be correct (pelleting and column capture
  are not sieving) but never checked against literature.
- MDA and RdAB now give nearly identical GC curves at their defaults, so the
  docstring claim that MDA bias is 2-5x stronger than PCR no longer holds.
- `--contamination-level failed` exists in `LEVEL_MULTIPLIERS` but neither CLI
  parser accepts it.

### The recurring failure mode

Four bugs in these sessions shared one shape: a value restated in two places, or
a constant that should scale. The CLI defaults table, the populate script's
UPDATE column list, the preset collection IDs, and a fixed `n_fragments`. Where
possible these now derive from one source with a test pinning the derivation.

## Collection Curation Protocol

**When adding new collections, always follow this protocol to avoid taxonomy issues:**

### 1. Research Phase
- Literature review for virome composition
- Identify dominant viruses and prevalence
- Document clinical/research applications

### 2. Script Creation
Create `scripts/curate_[collection]_virome_collection.py` with:
- Separate methods for each viral category
- SQL queries targeting specific viruses
- Abundance assignment based on literature

### 3. Proactive Taxonomy Rescanning (CRITICAL)
**Always verify expected viruses are present after initial run**

**Common Query Issues**:
- Non-human matches: Use specific patterns like `"Human bocavirus%"` not `"%bocavirus%"`
- Substring matches: Avoid broad patterns (e.g., `"%HIV%"` matches "Phives")
- Family name changes: ICTV taxonomy evolves (e.g., `Orthoherpesviridae` not `Herpesviridae`)
- Missing families: Some viruses have `family="Unknown"` (e.g., HCV)
- Word boundaries: Use `"Influenza A virus%"` to exclude parainfluenza

**Query Fix Patterns**:
```sql
-- Too broad
WHERE g.genome_name LIKE '%bocavirus%'
-- Better (human-specific)
WHERE g.genome_name LIKE 'Human bocavirus%'

-- Substring issues
WHERE g.genome_name LIKE '%HIV%'
-- Better (word boundary)
WHERE g.genome_name LIKE 'Human immunodeficiency virus%'

-- Explicit exclusions when needed
WHERE g.genome_name LIKE 'Respiratory syncytial virus%'
  AND g.genome_name NOT LIKE '%Bovine%'
  AND g.genome_name NOT LIKE '%Potato%'
```

### 4. Verification
- Check all CRITICAL biomarker viruses are present
- Verify genome counts match targets
- Confirm database insertion

### 5. Documentation
- Update README.md with collection details
- Include applications, literature basis, special notes

---

## Important Notes

### Security Considerations
**Web interface is for LOCAL USE or TRUSTED NETWORKS only**:
- No authentication implemented
- No HTTPS
- In-memory job tracking (not persistent)
- Localhost binding by default (127.0.0.1)

For production deployment: Add authentication, HTTPS, job queue, rate limiting.

### Taxonomy Limitations
- 88.9% of genomes are classified to class, 71.7% to family (after the 2026-07-16
  NCBI rank enrichment; see docs/BIOLOGICAL_ACCURACY_REVIEW.md)
- 28.3% (4,080) have `family="Unknown"` - largely modern bacteriophages that ICTV
  assigns to a genus but no family (families abolished 2021), so this is correct
  taxonomy, not a gap. 1,481 genomes are genuinely unclassified (no class).
- Enhanced fuzzy matching fixed 469 genomes; NCBI enrichment then classified 4,577
  more to class and 2,102 to family
- See `docs/TAXONOMY_BUG_FIX.md` for details

### Platform Requirements
**Short-read (Illumina)**: InSilicoSeq required
**Long-read (PacBio HiFi)**: PBSIM3 + pbccs (samtools) required
**Long-read (Nanopore)**: PBSIM3 required
**RNA workflows**: All dependencies above
**Web interface**: Flask >= 2.0.0

## Known Issues

**Interactive Preset Creation**
- Status: Not implemented (low priority)
- Workaround: Use `viroforge presets create <name> --from-dataset <path>`

**ISS Read Count Deviation for Small Genomes**
- InSilicoSeq `--mode basic` can produce fewer reads than expected for very small
  genomes due to rounding and minimum-read effects. Example: PhiX174 at 0.06%
  abundance with 537K total reads should produce ~322 reads but ISS generated 276.
- Impact: Small (< 15% deviation), only affects genomes with very low abundance.
- Workaround: Use actual output read counts rather than abundance-predicted counts
  when computing benchmarking metrics.

**PhiX174 Curation Fix (2026-03-22)**
- GCF_000819615.1 (Escherichia phage phiX174) was removed from 8 collections
  (9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18) because it is the same lab phage used as
  Illumina spike-in control. Including it as a natural virus causes QC tools
  that remove PhiX to also remove "natural" community reads.

**Vaginal Virome: Proxy Phages from Dairy/Food Lactobacillus (2026-06-02)**
- The vaginal virome collection (Collection 16) uses Lactobacillus phages from
  RefSeq as proxies for vaginal Lactobacillus phages. However, nearly all 60
  Lactobacillus phages in RefSeq infect dairy/food species (L. plantarum,
  L. delbrueckii, L. casei), not vaginal species (L. crispatus, L. iners,
  L. gasseri, L. jensenii).
- Only ~1 phage (Lv-1, infecting L. jensenii) is from a vaginal isolate.
- No Gardnerella, Prevotella, Atopobium, or Sneathia phages exist in RefSeq,
  preventing accurate modeling of CST IV (bacterial vaginosis) communities.
- Impact: The vaginal virome is biologically plausible at the family level
  (Lactobacillus phages dominate, HPV present) but not species-specific.
  Benchmarking results for vaginal datasets should note this limitation.
- CST (Community State Type) modeling is deferred until vaginal-specific
  phage genomes become available in public databases (RefSeq, INPHARED, GPD).
- Reference: Lv-1 vaginal phage (Lactobacillus jensenii) described in
  Miller-Ensminger et al. 2020 (PLOS One, PMC7289420).

**Dark Matter Sequences: Random Selection, Not Body-Site-Specific (2026-06-05)**
- The `--dark-matter-fraction` flag adds unclassified viral genomes (family='Unknown')
  to simulate the large fraction of reads in real viromes that do not match known
  references. As of v0.13.0 it is on by default (0.30).
- Dark matter genomes are selected randomly from the Unknown pool, NOT filtered by
  body site. A gut virome and a vaginal virome draw dark matter from the same pool.
- In reality dark matter is body-site-specific, but most Unknown-family genomes lack
  host/habitat metadata, making body-site filtering impractical.
- Exclusions applied: animal viruses, insect viruses, and known human viruses are
  excluded from the pool. Plant viruses are intentionally kept (dietary plant viruses
  are a real component of human gut viromes).
- Impact on QC benchmarking: none (QC tools process reads the same regardless of dark
  matter origin). Body-site specificity only matters for taxonomy benchmarking.

## Recent Bug Fixes (2025-11-16)

**HTML Report/Comparison Empty (FIXED)**
- Issue: HTML reports generated mostly empty content
- Root cause: Metadata field name mismatch between v1.1 schema and HTML templates
  - Templates accessed `metadata['platform']` - not present in v1.1
  - Templates accessed `metadata['vlp_enrichment']` - renamed to `enrichment_stats` in v1.1
- Fix: Updated both `report.py` and `compare.py` to use correct v1.1 field names
  - Platform info: `configuration['platform']`
  - VLP/enrichment info: `enrichment_stats['viral_enrichment']`, etc.
- Status: RESOLVED
- Files: `viroforge/cli/report.py:355-432`, `viroforge/cli/compare.py:294-337`

## Benchmarking Framework (Phase 13)

Modules 1, 2 and 4 are built and shipped in `viroforge/benchmarking/`, each with
a `viroforge benchmark <module>` subcommand, JSON and markdown reports, and an
independent-oracle test suite.

- **Module 1 QC** (`benchmark qc`): contamination removal and viral retention
  scored against per-read `source=` labels, with a read-name match-rate gate.
  Duplicates are scored separately. See `docs/PHASE13B_QC_BENCHMARK.md`.
- **Module 2 Assembly** (`benchmark assembly`): genome recovery, completeness
  and identity, chimeras, N50/L50, observed-vs-expected completeness, abundance
  accuracy. minimap2 via mappy, shared in `benchmarking/align.py` (the
  `benchmark` extra). See `docs/PHASE13B_ASSEMBLY_BENCHMARK.md`.
- **Module 4 Taxonomy** (`benchmark taxonomy`): read- and contig-based,
  taxid-exact plus genus/family via an NCBI taxdump, abundance profile,
  known/dark-matter stratification. Kraken2, Kaiju, Centrifuge, DIAMOND, MMseqs2
  and generic formats, auto-detected by default. See
  `docs/PHASE13C_TAXONOMY_BENCHMARK.md`.

Ground truth comes from metadata `benchmarking.{expected_coverage,taxonomy,
contamination_manifest}`, the per-read `source=` labels, and the source genome
FASTA.

**Not built**: Module 5 (completeness across coverage), HTML reports and
visualizations, length-weighted contig taxonomy metrics, and Modules 3 and 6-9
(binning, annotation, host prediction, novel discovery, end-to-end). See
`ROADMAP.md` and `docs/PHASE13_BENCHMARKING_FRAMEWORK.md`.

**Why it matters**: the field has no CAMI-equivalent benchmark for viromes.
Completing generate -> benchmark -> publish is what ViroForge is for.
