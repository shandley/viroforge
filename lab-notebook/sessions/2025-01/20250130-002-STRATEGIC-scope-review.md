# Strategic Scope Review: Virome-Specific Feature Coverage

**Date**: January 30, 2025
**Phase**: Transition (1→2)
**Status**: Complete

## Goals

**User Request**: "can we reflect and review the overall project scope. please ultrathink and consider if we have good exploration of virome types, including VLP/non-CLP, MDA, tagementation, etc. The code seems to be in a good place, but I want to take a step back and review the entire concept, scope and potential enhancements to build on"

Step back from implementation to:
1. Assess what virome-specific features are missing
2. Compare current coverage to real virome workflows
3. Identify critical gaps
4. Propose strategic options for Phase 2

## Background

Phase 1 focused on core metagenome simulation:
- Community composition (body sites, abundance distributions)
- Contamination (host DNA, rRNA, PhiX, reagent bacteria)
- FASTQ generation (InSilicoSeq integration)
- Validation framework

**Critical Question**: Does this actually simulate **viromes**, or just metagenomes with viral sequences?

## Key Finding: Critical Gap Identified

### Current Coverage: Only 42% of Real Virome Workflow

**Real VLP-Enriched Virome Workflow**:

| Step | Real Lab Protocol | Current ViroForge | Coverage |
|------|------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 1. Sample collection | Fecal/oral/etc | ✅ Body site profiles | ✅ 100% |
| 2. VLP enrichment | 0.2 μm filtration + nuclease | ❌ None | ❌ 0% |
| 3. Amplification | RdAB (40-cycle PCR) | ❌ None | ❌ 0% |
| 4. Library prep | Mechanical shearing/tagmentation | ⚠️ Generic | ⚠️ 50% |
| 5. Sequencing | NovaSeq (2-channel, polyG) | ⚠️ NovaSeq (basic) | ⚠️ 50% |
| 6. QC analysis | ViromeQC, contamination check | ✅ Ground truth for testing | ✅ 100% |

**Overall Coverage**: 42% (3.5/6 steps modeled realistically)

### Critical Missing Features

**VLP Enrichment (CRITICAL)** ❌
- 0.2-0.45 μm filtration (size-based viral enrichment)
- Nuclease treatment (removes free host DNA/RNA)
- Effect: 10-100× increase in viral:host ratio
- **This is THE defining feature of viromics**

**Amplification Bias (CRITICAL)** ❌
- RdAB: 40-cycle PCR with length and GC bias
- MDA: φ29 polymerase with extreme GC bias
- No-amplification: Different artifacts
- Effect: Distorts viral composition, affects diversity

**Platform Artifacts (Important)** ⚠️
- NovaSeq: 2-channel chemistry → polyG tails, optical duplicates
- MiSeq: 4-channel chemistry → different error profile
- Effect: Realistic sequencing artifacts for testing QC

**Library Prep Methods (Important)** ⚠️
- Mechanical shearing: Uniform fragmentation
- Tagmentation (Nextera): GC bias, different size distribution
- Effect: Different coverage patterns

## Four Strategic Options Presented

### Option A: Quick Publication (~2 months)
- Keep current scope (Phase 1 only)
- Add real genomes
- Publish as "metagenome simulator with virome profiles"
- **Pros**: Fast publication
- **Cons**: Doesn't actually model virome-specific biology

### Option B: Comprehensive Scope (~6 months)
- Add ALL features: VLP, amplification, artifacts, library prep
- Multiple protocols for each
- Extensive validation
- **Pros**: Complete tool
- **Cons**: Long timeline, scope creep risk

### Option C: Focused Depth (~2-3 months)
- Focus on YOUR lab's specific protocols
- VLP (your method), RdAB (your method), NovaSeq (your platform)
- Deep validation against your real data
- **Pros**: Directly useful for your work
- **Cons**: Lab-specific, not community tool

### Option D: Modular Framework (~4 months)
- Create flexible frameworks for each feature
- Support multiple protocols via configuration
- Community can extend
- **Pros**: Lab-agnostic, extensible
- **Cons**: More design complexity

## User Feedback: Critical Direction Change

**Initial Interest**: Option C (focused on specific protocols)

**Critical Clarification**: "I think I am most interested in Option C, however, I am not interested in viroforge just being useful for my labs protocols. I would like to make this available to the larger community for use, so I do not want to narrow our scope to just our lab. I want this to be fully devlope, tested and robust and agnostic to my lab"

**Key Requirements Identified**:
1. ✅ Focused implementation (like Option C's timeline)
2. ✅ BUT lab-agnostic (not specific to one protocol)
3. ✅ Community-focused (serves entire field)
4. ✅ Fully developed, tested, robust
5. ✅ Publication-quality

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid

**Combine Option C's focused timeline with Option D's modular approach**

**Core Principle**: Flexible frameworks, not hard-coded protocols

**Example - VLP Enrichment**:
```python
# NOT hard-coded:
def vlp_enrichment_handley_lab():
    # Only works for one lab
    pass

# INSTEAD - Flexible framework:
vlp = VLPEnrichment(
    filtration_cutoff_um=0.2,  # User-configurable
    nuclease_efficiency=0.95,
    method='tangential_flow'
)
vlp.apply(composition)
```

**Supports**:
- Any filtration cutoff (0.1-0.45 μm reported in literature)
- Any nuclease efficiency
- Different filtration methods
- Pre-defined templates for common workflows

## Strategic Value for Field

**Current Gap in Field**:
- Physical mock communities: $10k+, limited complexity
- CAMISIM: Bacterial-focused, no VLP modeling
- Real datasets: Unknown ground truth

**ViroForge Fills Gap**:
- Unlimited synthetic datasets with complete ground truth
- VLP vs bulk metagenome comparisons
- Realistic virome-specific features
- Standardized benchmarking for community

**Publication Potential**: High (Nature Biotechnology level)
- Novel contribution: First virome-specific simulator
- Community need: Tool validation is critical problem
- Methodology: Systematic, literature-validated approach

## Next Steps

- [x] Complete strategic review (this document)
- [x] Create Phase 2 implementation plan
- [ ] Begin VLP enrichment framework (Week 1 of Phase 2)

**Status**: Complete
**Impact**: Clear strategic direction established. ViroForge will be community-focused, lab-agnostic tool with modular architecture. Phase 2 will implement core virome-specific features (VLP enrichment, amplification bias, platform artifacts) as flexible frameworks over 12 weeks.
